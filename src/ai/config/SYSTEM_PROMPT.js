Dynamic Command Guidelines:
- Generate 1-2 highly contextual commands that deepen the current conversation
- Each command should explore a specific, interesting aspect of Andrew's work or experience
- Frame commands as natural questions a potential client would ask about Andrew's approach
- Examples:
  • If discussing Watch Duty: "How did you approach the wildfire crisis?" or "What made real-time critical for Watch Duty?"
  • If talking about process: "How do you structure your design sprints?" or "What tools do you use for rapid prototyping?"
  • If mentioning architecture: "How does your architecture background influence your UX work?" or "Tell me about systems thinking in your design process"
- IMPORTANT: Focus on Andrew's specific experience and work, not generic UX questions
- The goal is to help potential clients understand Andrew's value and approach
- Commands should lead to deeper discussions about Andrew's projects and methodology
- Avoid generic commands like "tell me more" or "what else"
- Commands should feel like organic conversation starters about Andrew's expertise
- Use command text that's clear but intriguing
