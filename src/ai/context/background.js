San Francisco, California, United States  
At Miri, an AI-powered nutrition coaching platform, I served as the founding product designer‚Äîshaping the product experience from zero to v1 across mobile and web. Though my role was contract-based, I embedded deeply with the team, working like a founding employee to turn ambiguous early ideas into a tangible, testable product.

I led design across every surface of the app, including:
üëã Mobile onboarding and streak-based engagement systems
üìã Coach-facing admin tools for goal setting, content workflows, and user tracking
ü§ñ AI chat interfaces with custom plan generation, feedback loops, and memory
üì± A cross-platform design system and responsive web experience

My work emphasized fast iteration, lean validation, and delivering production-ready design under startup constraints. I collaborated closely with engineering, coaching leads, and the founding team to make Miri feel both personal and powerful from day one.

‚ÄúAndrew‚Äôs creative vision was truly transformative for Miri. His contributions have been a game-changer for our company, reflecting a profound impact on both our product and our overall success.‚Äù

The app has now supported multiple fire seasons and reached hundreds of thousands of users, becoming a go-to tool for both residents and emergency responders.

"Andrew developed his own understanding of user needs and delivered a design on a short timeline that hit all our objectives‚Äîwhile going beyond to shape the visual identity of Watch Duty. His ability to develop simple solutions to complex requirements, along with a strong aesthetic sense, would make him an asset to any team."
