## Work History

### Miri AI
**Founding Product Designer (Contract)**  
*Feb 2023 – Feb 2025*  
San Francisco, California, United States  
At Miri, an AI-powered nutrition coaching platform, I served as the founding product designer—shaping the product experience from zero to v1 across mobile and web. Though my role was contract-based, I embedded deeply with the team, working like a founding employee to turn ambiguous early ideas into a tangible, testable product.

I led design across every surface of the app, including:
👋 Mobile onboarding and streak-based engagement systems
📋 Coach-facing admin tools for goal setting, content workflows, and user tracking
🤖 AI chat interfaces with custom plan generation, feedback loops, and memory
📱 A cross-platform design system and responsive web experience

My work emphasized fast iteration, lean validation, and delivering production-ready design under startup constraints. I collaborated closely with engineering, coaching leads, and the founding team to make Miri feel both personal and powerful from day one.

"Andrew's creative vision was truly transformative for Miri. His contributions have been a game-changer for our company, reflecting a profound impact on both our product and our overall success."
— Boris Korsunsky, Miri's CTO


### Watch Duty ###
**Founding Product Designer (Volunteer)**
Jun 2021 - Jan 2022
Watch Duty is a nonprofit wildfire tracking app that delivers critical safety updates to people in the path of wildfires. I was brought on when the product was still an early engineering prototype, and led design across the core mobile experience, helping define how fire-related data is surfaced, interpreted, and trusted in real time.

Working on nights and weekends, I:
👯‍♀️ Designed the first production version of the mobile app, focused on helping users assess risk across multiple fires
🗺️ Developed the core map UI with text updates, images, and status indicators
🔥 Created the Watch Duty logo and visual identity, still in use across the app and brand
💁‍♂️ Translated a complex set of requirements—from local fire behavior to user stress and trust—into a calm, intuitive experience

The app has now supported multiple fire seasons and reached hundreds of thousands of users, becoming a go-to tool for both residents and emergency responders.

"Andrew developed his own understanding of user needs and delivered a design on a short timeline that hit all our objectives—while going beyond to shape the visual identity of Watch Duty. His ability to develop simple solutions to complex requirements, along with a strong aesthetic sense, would make him an asset to any team."
— Lukas, PM at Watch Duty

### Meta
**Senior Product Designer (Reality Labs)**  
*Jan 2021 – Nov 2022*  
San Francisco Bay Area  
I led product design for the Meta Quest mobile app—the companion to Meta's VR headset and a key entry point to the broader metaverse ecosystem. With over 10 million downloads in 2022 and the #1 spot in the App Store during the 2021 holiday season, the app plays a critical role in user onboarding, engagement, and revenue for the Quest platform.

As the design lead, I:
📱 Owned end-to-end design for the mobile app, including the Explore feed, a primary user surface
🙌 Supported cross-functional efforts across Store, Notifications, Social, and Device Setup by running design reviews, crits, and maintaining app-wide design quality
🎨 Championed usability, coherence, and polish across multiple teams and stakeholders
🧪 Pioneered new features like the VR-to-mobile media gallery—later handed off to a dedicated media team for further development

I worked closely with 10+ engineers and designers across Reality Labs to ensure the mobile experience functioned not just as a utility, but as a real extension of the headset—helping people discover content, connect with others, and get more out of VR.

**Senior Product Designer (Oculus)**  
*Jan 2020 – Jan 2021*  
Menlo Park, California  
Designed social features to make VR more connected, spontaneous, and shareable. Highlights include:

🖖 Invented the "metaverse deeplink", a system that lets users share their live location in VR so friends can instantly "teleport" into the same experience, for which I earned a patent.
💬 Helped bring Facebook Messenger into VR, enabling users to stay connected across platforms

Collaborated closely with engineers, PMs, and platform teams to push the boundaries of social presence in virtual space.*Sep 2016 – Jan 2020*  

** Product Designer (Internal data and HR tools)**  
*Sep 2016 – Jan 2020*  
Menlo Park, California  
Designed internal tools used daily by Facebook employees to make better decisions, support teams, and grow their careers. My work spanned both the Data and People Products orgs, where I focused on usability, clarity, and impact at scale.

Designed and developed products that revolutionize how governments understand, explore, and plan their public finances.

### Financial Diligence Networks
**Lead Designer**  
*Nov 2012 – Dec 2013*  
Boston, MA
