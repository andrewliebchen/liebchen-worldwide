        <h2>Say hello to your first designer</h2>
        <p>
          The early stages of a start-up are exciting and challenging. With an
          abundance of ideas and a paucity of resources, you need team members
          who can wear multiple hats, deliver high-quality results, and add
          value beyond their immediate role.

        <h2>I bring ideas to life</h2>

          As your fractional product designer, I plug seamlessly into your team
          to drive the product development journey.

          designer to your project - on a contractor basis.

        <p>
          I am committed to your start-up's success. As part of my unique
